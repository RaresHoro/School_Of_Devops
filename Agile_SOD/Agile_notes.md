## ðŸš€ What is Agile?

Agile is a mindset and methodology focused on delivering value **incrementally** and **collaboratively**. It emphasizes:

- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Responding to change** over following a rigid plan
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

### ðŸ”‘ Core Values (Agile Manifesto)

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### ðŸ§­ Key Principles

- Deliver working software frequently (weeks, not months)
- Embrace changing requirementsâ€”even late in development
- Business people and developers must work together daily
- Build projects around motivated individuals
- Simplicityâ€”the art of maximizing the amount of work not doneâ€”is essential

## ðŸ“¦ Agile Project Management & Delivery

Agile Project Management (APM) aims to **maximize value and minimize waste** through adaptive planning, early delivery, and continual improvement.

### ðŸ”„ Iterative & Incremental Delivery

- Work is divided into small, manageable **iterations (Sprints)**
- Each iteration delivers a **potentially shippable product increment**
- Priorities are managed dynamically via the **Product Backlog**

### ðŸ’¼ Agile Roles (General)

- **Product Owner (PO):** Defines the product vision and prioritizes the backlog
- **Team Members:** Cross-functional developers/designers/testers
- **Facilitator (Scrum Master):** Helps the team follow Agile practices

## ðŸ§  Inside The Scrum Team: A 15-Minute Introduction

Scrum is the most popular Agile framework. It defines clear roles, events, and artifacts.

### ðŸ‘¥ Scrum Roles

1. **Product Owner (PO):**
   - Owns the **Product Backlog**
   - Represents stakeholders and the business
   - Prioritizes features based on value

2. **Scrum Master:**
   - Facilitates Scrum ceremonies
   - Removes impediments
   - Coaches the team on Agile values

3. **Development Team:**
   - Self-organizing
   - Cross-functional (design, dev, test, etc.)
   - Delivers a potentially releasable increment each Sprint

### ðŸ›  Scrum Artifacts

- **Product Backlog:** Ordered list of everything needed in the product
- **Sprint Backlog:** Set of items selected for the current Sprint
- **Increment:** The sum of all completed Product Backlog items

### ðŸ“… Scrum Events

| Event              | Purpose                                         | Timeboxed |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Sprint            | A fixed-length iteration (usually 2â€“4 weeks)    | Varies    |
| Sprint Planning   | Define what to deliver and how                  | ~8 hours  |
| Daily Scrum       | Inspect progress and adapt                       | 15 mins   |
| Sprint Review     | Show what was delivered to stakeholders          | ~4 hours  |
| Sprint Retrospective | Improve the process                          | ~3 hours  |

## âœ… Summary

Agile and Scrum promote a culture of **collaboration, adaptability, and transparency**. Agile Delivery ensures that products evolve through **incremental improvements**, and Scrum structures teams and work in a way that encourages continuous progress, feedback, and learning.

By following these principles, teams can **deliver faster**, **respond to change**, and **increase customer satisfaction**.
