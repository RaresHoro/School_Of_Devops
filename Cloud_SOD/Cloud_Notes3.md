# ü§ñ Service Principal (Non-Human User)

## What Is a Service Principal?

A **Service Principal** is a **non-human identity** used in Azure to authenticate and authorize applications, scripts, or automation tools (like Terraform, GitHub Actions, or DevOps pipelines) to interact with Azure resources.

Think of it as a **"bot account"** for your app or pipeline that logs into Azure on its behalf.

---

## üß± Why Service Principals Matter

### ‚úÖ Secure, Scalable Access
- Allows fine-grained, scoped, and time-limited access.
- Avoids credential sprawl and hardcoded secrets.

### ‚úÖ Non-Interactive Use
- Designed for automation, not human login.
- Used with Azure CLI, SDKs, Terraform, CI/CD, and more.

---

## üîê How Service Principals Work

Each Service Principal is backed by:
- An **Azure AD App Registration**
- A **secret or certificate**
- An assigned **role** for RBAC access

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Example: Azure CLI Login in a Pipeline

```bash
az login --service-principal \
  --username <appId> \
  --password <secret> \
  --tenant <tenantId>
```

Allows non-human login for CI/CD or scripting.

## üéØ Typical Roles and Permissions

| Role Name    | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| Reader       | Read-only access                     |
| Contributor  | Read + write (no RBAC changes)       |
| Owner        | Full control, including RBAC         |
| Custom Role  | Tailored to specific needs           |

---

## üß† Best Practices

- Use **least privilege** (don't assign Owner unless required)
- Prefer **short-lived secrets or certificates**
- Use **Managed Identity** if supported by the resource
- Store secrets securely (e.g., **Azure Key Vault**)
- Prefer **federated identities** (e.g., GitHub OIDC) when possible

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Managed Identity  | Azure-managed Service Principal tied to a resource              |
| App Registration  | Identity definition in Azure AD                                |
| RBAC              | Role-Based Access Control ‚Äî defines what the SP can do         |
| Key Vault         | Ideal place to store SP secrets or certificates securely        |

## üí° Summary

> A **Service Principal** is the go-to identity mechanism in Azure for **apps, pipelines, and automation tools** to access resources securely.

It‚Äôs foundational for:
- DevOps pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions)
- Terraform and Bicep deployments
- Application-to-Azure communication
- Programmatic Azure management

# üîê Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)

## ‚úÖ What Is the Principle of Least Privilege?

The **Principle of Least Privilege** (PoLP) states that **any user, application, service, or process should be granted only the minimum permissions necessary to perform its intended task ‚Äî nothing more**.

It's a fundamental security concept used to reduce the attack surface and limit the potential damage from mistakes or malicious activity.

---

## üîç Why It Matters in Azure

In Azure, permissions are granted using **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. These permissions can be assigned at various scopes such as subscription, resource group, or specific resources.

Without applying least privilege:
- Users may get **Owner** access when they only need **Reader**.
- Service Principals might have **wide permissions** across the subscription when they only need access to one resource.
- Misconfigured automation or compromised accounts could impact **all** resources.

### Benefits:
- Minimizes **unauthorized access**
- Reduces **blast radius** in case of compromise
- Helps achieve **compliance** and better **auditability**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Implement Least Privilege in Azure

### 1. Assign Roles at the Smallest Necessary Scope
- Prefer **resource** or **resource group** scope instead of **subscription-wide** access.

### 2. Use Built-in Roles First
- Azure has predefined roles like:
  - `Reader`
  - `Contributor`
  - `Virtual Machine Contributor`
- Avoid `Owner` unless absolutely necessary.

### 3. Create Custom Roles If Needed
- When built-in roles don't fit, define a **custom role** with the exact required actions.
- Example: `Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read`

### 4. Review and Audit Access Regularly
- Use **Azure Policy** and **Access Reviews** via Azure AD.
- Remove inactive users, groups, or Service Principals.

### 5. Use Time-Bound Access
- Enable **Just-In-Time (JIT) access** using **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**.
- Ideal for high-privilege roles like `Owner` or `User Access Administrator`.

### 6. Avoid Overprivileged Service Principals
- Limit Service Principal access to only the scope it needs (e.g., a single resource group).
- Prefer **Managed Identities** when possible.

---

## üîÑ Real-World Example

> A developer only needs to deploy and manage App Services.

### ‚úÖ Recommended:
Assign them the `Website Contributor` or `Web Plan Contributor` role **at the resource group level**.

### ‚ùå Not Recommended:
Granting `Owner` role at the **subscription level** exposes unnecessary risk and broad control over unrelated resources.

---

## üß† Summary

The **Principle of Least Privilege** is a core security best practice:

- Grant **only the access required** ‚Äî no more.
- Regularly **audit and prune** unused or excessive permissions.
- Helps secure automation (Service Principals), users, and systems.
- Essential for **security, compliance, and operational integrity**.

By applying PoLP, you make your Azure environment more resilient, secure, and controlled.

# üåê NAT vs Public IP in Azure

Understanding the difference between **NAT (Network Address Translation)** and **Public IP Addresses** is essential for designing secure and efficient network architectures in Azure.

---

## üî∏ Public IP Address

A **Public IP** is a globally routable IP address assigned to a resource that allows **inbound and outbound communication with the internet**.

### ‚úÖ Characteristics:
- Globally unique
- Can be **static** or **dynamic**
- Assigned directly to a VM, Load Balancer, App Gateway, etc.
- Enables **direct access** (e.g., SSH, RDP, HTTP)

### üìå Example Use Cases:
- Assigning a public IP to a VM for SSH access
- Hosting a public-facing website on a load balancer

---

## üî∏ Network Address Translation (NAT)

**NAT** allows multiple private resources (e.g., VMs in a subnet) to **share one or more public IPs** for **outbound-only communication** to the internet.

### ‚úÖ Characteristics:
- **Outbound internet access only** (no direct inbound access)
- Hides internal private IPs from external exposure
- Can be scaled using **Azure NAT Gateway**
- More secure by reducing exposed surface

### üß± Common NAT Forms in Azure:
- **SNAT** ‚Äì Source NAT for outbound connectivity
- **DNAT** ‚Äì Destination NAT for routing inbound connections via load balancer rules
- **NAT Gateway** ‚Äì Managed outbound NAT service for subnets

---

## üîç Key Differences

| Feature                  | Public IP                          | NAT (e.g., NAT Gateway or SNAT)        |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Inbound Access           | ‚úÖ Yes                             | ‚ùå No (unless via DNAT or LB rule)     |
| Outbound Access          | ‚úÖ Yes                             | ‚úÖ Yes                                 |
| Exposure to Internet     | Direct                             | Indirect (internal IP is hidden)       |
| IP Usage                 | One IP per resource (usually)      | One IP shared by many                  |
| Security Implication     | Requires securing exposed endpoint | Minimizes exposure                     |
| Use Case                 | Remote login, public-facing apps   | Outbound traffic from private subnets  |

---

## üß† When to Use What?

- **Use a Public IP when**:
  - You need **direct access** to a resource from the internet
  - You're hosting **public APIs**, websites, or need **remote login**

- **Use NAT when**:
  - You want to **enable outbound-only access** for VMs
  - You need to **secure internal resources** without exposing them publicly
  - You want **centralized control** over outbound IPs using NAT Gateway

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Public IP**: Direct, full internet access (both inbound and outbound), more exposed.
- **NAT**: Enables outbound access for private resources with **no direct inbound**, ideal for secure environments.

Both are essential tools in Azure networking‚Äîchoose based on access needs and security posture.
