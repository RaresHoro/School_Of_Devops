# What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Why Use It?

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is a modern approach to managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (like servers, databases, networks, etc.) through **machine-readable configuration files**, rather than through manual processes.

Think of IaC as **"coding your infrastructure"** – just like software, you write scripts or declarative configuration to describe what infrastructure you want, and tools (like Terraform, Ansible, or AWS CloudFormation) automatically provision and maintain it for you.

---

## 🛠 What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?

IaC uses configuration files (often in formats like YAML, JSON, or HCL) to define and manage infrastructure. These files are:

- Stored in version control systems like Git.
- Used by IaC tools to create, update, or delete resources in cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

There are two main styles:
- **Declarative** (you describe the desired end state; e.g., Terraform)
- **Imperative** (you specify the exact steps to get there; e.g., Ansible)

---

## ✅ Benefits of Using IaC

### 1. **Consistency**

- Manual setup leads to configuration drift — different environments (dev, test, prod) might behave differently.
- IaC ensures every environment is built from the **same source of truth**.
- Reduces human error, which is one of the most common causes of outages.

### 2. **Repeatability**

- Once you've defined your infrastructure in code, you can reuse it any number of times.
- Spin up **identical environments** in seconds for testing, staging, or disaster recovery.
- Example: Easily recreate a staging environment that matches production 1:1.

### 3. **Versioning & History**

- Changes to infrastructure are tracked via Git (or another version control system).
- You can:
  - Roll back to previous versions.
  - See **who changed what and when**.
  - Run **code reviews** and **approval workflows**.

### 4. **Collaboration**

- IaC treats infrastructure like software – enabling developers, DevOps engineers, and teams to **collaborate using familiar tools** (e.g., GitHub).
- Enables **peer reviews**, **pull requests**, and **automated testing** before deploying infrastructure changes.
- Promotes a **DevOps culture**, integrating infrastructure and software development teams.

---

## 🚀 Why It Matters in Practice

Without IaC:
- You rely on **manual steps**, which are error-prone and slow.
- There's often **little documentation** on how an environment was created.
- Scaling infrastructure is cumbersome.

With IaC:
- You get **fast, reliable, and repeatable deployments**.
- Infrastructure becomes **scalable, testable, and maintainable**.
- Teams move faster and safer with **automation and standardization**.

# Introduction to Terraform Basics

Terraform is an open-source **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to **define, provision, and manage infrastructure** across a wide range of cloud providers using declarative configuration files.

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. **Providers**

- A **provider** is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with APIs from different services like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, GitHub, Kubernetes, etc.
- When you define a provider in your Terraform code, you're telling Terraform **what platform or service to manage**.

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features = {}
}
```

---

### 2. **Resources**

- A **resource** is the **core component** in Terraform — it represents a piece of infrastructure you want to create, like a virtual machine, storage account, network, or container.
- You define resources using configuration blocks in `.tf` files.

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "East US"
}
```

---

### 3. **Data Sources**

- A **data source** allows Terraform to **read** and use information from existing resources managed outside of Terraform or created in earlier modules.
- Useful for referencing existing infrastructure without managing its lifecycle.

```hcl
data "azurerm_subscription" "primary" {}
```

---

### 4. **Variables**

- **Variables** make your Terraform code more flexible and reusable.
- You define them in a `variables.tf` file and can pass values via CLI, environment variables, or `.tfvars` files.

```hcl
variable "location" {
  type    = string
  default = "East US"
}
```

---

### 5. **State Files**

- Terraform uses a **state file** (`terraform.tfstate`) to keep track of what infrastructure it manages and their current states.
- This file is **critical** for Terraform to know what to create, update, or destroy.
- You can store it locally or remotely (e.g., in an S3 bucket or Azure Blob Storage) for collaboration.

---

### 6. **How Terraform Interacts with Cloud Platforms**

- Terraform reads your `.tf` configuration files and uses the defined **provider** to translate them into **API calls** to the cloud platform.
- Typical workflow:

```shell
terraform init     
terraform plan     
terraform apply    
terraform destroy  
```

# Understand Terraform Workflow and Best Practices

Terraform enables you to automate the provisioning and management of your infrastructure using a clear and structured workflow. Understanding the Terraform lifecycle and best practices is key to maintaining reliable, secure, and reusable infrastructure code.

---

## 🔄 Terraform Workflow: Plan, Apply, Destroy

Terraform follows a simple yet powerful workflow:

### 1. `terraform init`

- Initializes the working directory and downloads the necessary provider plugins.
- Should be run before any other Terraform commands.

### 2. `terraform plan`

- Shows the **execution plan** — what actions Terraform will take to match the real infrastructure to the desired configuration.
- Helps catch unintended changes **before** applying them.

```shell
terraform plan
```

### 3. `terraform apply`

- Executes the planned changes and provisions infrastructure.
- Prompts for approval before proceeding (unless `-auto-approve` is used).

```shell
terraform apply
```

### 4. `terraform destroy`

- Destroys all resources managed by Terraform in the current configuration.
- Useful for tearing down environments or doing cleanup.

```shell
terraform destroy
```

---

## 🔐 Storing State Securely

Terraform stores information about managed infrastructure in a **state file** (`terraform.tfstate`).

### Why State Matters

- It maps resources defined in your code to actual resources in the cloud.
- It tracks metadata and dependencies to ensure correct behavior during updates.

### Best Practices for State Management

- **Use Remote Backends** (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage):
  - Enables team collaboration.
  - Protects state from being lost or corrupted.
  - Supports locking (via DynamoDB or Azure storage) to prevent race conditions.

- **Encrypt State Files**:
  - Always enable encryption when using cloud storage to protect sensitive data.

- **Avoid Checking State into Version Control**:
  - Never commit `.tfstate` or `.tfstate.backup` files to Git or other VCS.

---

## 📦 Using Modules for Reusable Code

Modules allow you to **organize and reuse** Terraform code across projects.

### Benefits of Using Modules

- **DRY Principle**: Avoid repeating the same code.
- **Maintainability**: Update shared logic in one place.
- **Consistency**: Standardize infrastructure components like VMs, networks, or databases.

### Module Structure

```plaintext
main.tf          # Root configuration
modules/
  vm/
    main.tf
    variables.tf
    outputs.tf
```

### Example Module Usage

```hcl
module "vm_example" {
  source   = "./modules/vm"
  vm_name  = "web-server"
  location = "East US"
}
```

---

## ✅ Summary of Best Practices

- Use `terraform plan` before `apply` to catch issues early.
- Store state securely in remote, encrypted, and locked backends.
- Use modules to create reusable, composable infrastructure components.
- Keep secrets out of code (use environment variables or secret managers).
- Enable version control for all `.tf` files and use meaningful commit messages.
